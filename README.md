🌱 **EcoArtTrack — A Salesforce Agentforce–Powered Sustainability App**

EcoArtTrack is a Salesforce Agentforce–powered sustainability and carbon-tracking app built to help students, artists, and organizations measure the environmental impact of the art materials they use. Using custom Salesforce objects, AI prompt templates, flows, validations, list views, dashboards, and Agentforce AI reasoning, the app transforms everyday art activities into measurable environmental awareness and action.

The app is available on desktop and fully supported in the Salesforce Mobile App (iOS & Android), allowing students to record materials and view sustainability insights from anywhere.

🎨 **Project Description**

Every art project begins with creativity — but behind each brushstroke, sketch, sculpture, or paper craft lies an environmental footprint that often goes unseen. Acrylic paints release microplastics, paper production emits CO₂ and consumes water, and common supplies like tape, glue, markers, and canvas generate hidden emissions through chemical processing and transportation.

EcoArtTrack makes these impacts visible, measurable, and easy to understand.

**Designed for students and sustainability programs, the app:**

- Logs materials used in art projects

- Automatically calculates carbon emissions

- Tracks CO₂ reduction goals

- Visualizes impact through dashboards

- Sends automated alerts when goals are achieved

- Generates AI-written sustainability summaries using Salesforce Agentforce AI

**EcoArtTrack was engineered end-to-end using:**

- Custom Objects (Project, Material, Usage)

- Master-Detail relationships and roll-ups

- Validation Rules for carbon accuracy

- Permission Sets for secure data access

- Formula Fields for CO₂ and cost

- Record-Triggered Flows

- Quick Actions & Screen Flows

- Custom List Views

- Reports & Dashboards

- Agentforce AI Prompt Templates

- AI-generated sustainability summaries

EcoArtTrack helps young creators understand how their material choices affect the planet — transforming awareness into action.
